Learning DS&amp;A progress tracker

<b>Day 1</b>
Read "Behind the scenes chapter of CTCI. Discusses the different types of interview practices at different big tech companies. 
For facebook, and in general, good to prepare for code reviews. Read this: https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/
Generally there are screening phone interviews which are usually tech heavy. Then you're called onto campus for on-site coding and algorithm heavy interviews along with behavioural and lunch interviews. Your recruiter is your best friend and advocate, use that. 
A lot of companies will ask scalability questions so prepare well for system design. Don't know how important this will be for college grads

<b>Day 2 </b>
Nightime reading before sleeping. Read one of the intro sections, like what an interviewer can learn from this book on how to properly, fairly and effectively assess a candidate. Also read about special or unique situations like when an acquisition happens, or an acquihire, the engineers of the company getting acquired are re-interviewed just like a normal dev would be by the acquirer, and so how to prep for that properly. There was also advice for experienced candidates and what they should focus on when preparing for an interview. Then there was advice for SDET or software design engineers in test that test prod code and stuff, how they should prepare when transitioning to a dev role. Advice for Project managers, dev leads and managers. Also read the behind the scenes at palantir. 

<b>Day 3 </b>
Spent more time than yesterday. Finished reading the special situations chapter, the part where it gives advice to interviewers on how to properly interview a candidate, do's and don'ts. One interesting part of the advice to interviews was the 'probe deeper on behavioral questions' part. A lot of people don't focus on what they did but what the team did. As an interviewer it is their responsibility to ask more, because that person could be a great employee but just not a good candidate. By asking questions you can make them a good candidate. There was a part about types of questions asked like sanity check (easy), quality check (hard), specialist and then proxy knowledge (should know having worked on x for so long). Then I got to the more relevant part, how to start preparing for technical interviews. Here I read about the preparation timeline. Realized I have a lot to do in terms of just prepping outside of techincal questions. There are things I kind of knew but never paid attention to or took seriously
