# 90DayDSA
Learning DS&amp;A progress tracker

<b>Day 1</b>
Read "Behind the scenes chapter of CTCI. Discusses the different types of interview practices at different big tech companies. 
For facebook, and in general, good to prepare for code reviews. Read this: https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/
Generally there are screening phone interviews which are usually tech heavy. Then you're called onto campus for on-site coding and algorithm heavy interviews along with behavioural and lunch interviews. Your recruiter is your best friend and advocate, use that. 
A lot of companies will ask scalability questions so prepare well for system design. Don't know how important this will be for college grads

<b>Day 2 </b>
Nightime reading before sleeping. Read one of the intro sections, like what an interviewer can learn from this book on how to properly, fairly and effectively assess a candidate. Also read about special or unique situations like when an acquisition happens, or an acquihire, the engineers of the company getting acquired are re-interviewed just like a normal dev would be by the acquirer, and so how to prep for that properly. There was also advice for experienced candidates and what they should focus on when preparing for an interview. Then there was advice for SDET or software design engineers in test that test prod code and stuff, how they should prepare when transitioning to a dev role. Advice for Project managers, dev leads and managers. Also read the behind the scenes at palantir. 

<b>Day 3 </b>
Spent more time than yesterday. Finished reading the special situations chapter, the part where it gives advice to interviewers on how to properly interview a candidate, do's and don'ts. One interesting part of the advice to interviews was the 'probe deeper on behavioral questions' part. A lot of people don't focus on what they did but what the team did. As an interviewer it is their responsibility to ask more, because that person could be a great employee but just not a good candidate. By asking questions you can make them a good candidate. There was a part about types of questions asked like sanity check (easy), quality check (hard), specialist and then proxy knowledge (should know having worked on x for so long). Then I got to the more relevant part, how to start preparing for technical interviews. Here I read about the preparation timeline. Realized I have a lot to do in terms of just prepping outside of techincal questions. There are things I kind of knew but never paid attention to or took seriously or just haven't done it. First was getting experience and being serious about coding consistently and a lot and learning new things in that. So I made a list of things I need to do. 
-	Make a portfolio website to showcase my projects and other stuff
-	Take up and ask for more meaty projects at brandywine which I can put on my resume
-	Work on personal projects that show passion and intitiative and its easy to see my contribution in them. can also contribute to open souce projects. 
-	Work on DSA obviously
Then I learned that there is stigma. Obviously. Stuff like don’t be too attached to just one programming language and how you should diversify. Ceritification can also be seen in a multitude of ways but best not to focus on them and focus on personal projects instead. Know C++, Java and Python for eg. 
Then there was the preparation map which shows what I should be doing when. Very helpful indeed. 
Then we get to how to answer behavioral questions, the different types of BQs, what I should ask the interviewer at the end to showcase interest, knowledge and genuine curiosity. Then the part on how to respond to behavioral questions. Focusing on myself and what part I played is crucial. I was of the belief that that would come across arrogant and egotistic, but apparently not. Makes sense, I’m the one being interviewed not my team. Then how to prepare my stories for technical projects and situations in general. There’s a nice grid given which I can refer to when preparing the story. You first give a nugget which set up exactly what the story is about instead of just starting the story. Then you do S.A.R which is situation action and result. Make situation and result brief and action long and detailed. Make sure it shows your qualities like empathy and leadership and all that good stuff. 

<b> Day 4 </b>
Started by reviewing the concepts of learning I learned in the course Learning how to Learn. Then started with learning about big O notation and time complextiy. Found a great explanation video on youtube by freecodecamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4vesaut8g&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

<b> Day 5 </b>
Continued Learning about Big O, and also followed along while coding to understand better. Have to repeat and practice the concepts a few times for them to stick though, so review what you learned the days before before you start learning something new. It will take less time each time you review, and will make sure you retain the information better. Learned today about O(log n) using binarySearch and O(n log n) using mergeSort
